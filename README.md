<p>*The informations on this project are more related to the video games then the cartoon*</p>

## Pokedex

This project was made based on a Video Game/Cartoon known as Pokémon.

## Pages

<h3>Home</h3>

<img width="300px" src="/src/assets/Readme/Home.png" alt="Home do projeto">

The home page is where you can find paths to all the generations of Pokémon.

<h3>Generation 1-9</h3>

The pages where you can learn little bit more about that generation.

- Artwork of the main region of that generation.
- Little bit of information about <b>Geography</b> and <b>Demographics</b> about that region.
- List with all Pokémons of that generation.

## Details

The Details page is accessible when you click on a Pokémon 'card.' For example, when you are on the Generation 1 page, if you scroll down, you will be able to see a list of Pokémon. When you click on one of them, it will redirect you to a page where you can find all the information about that specific Pokémon.

<h3>Header</h3>
 
The design of the header is simple, but I really like it. The main thing, in my opinion, that makes the header good is the background that changes color based on the Pokémon.

You can also see 4 different images of Pokémon: Classic/Classic Shiny -- Official Artwork/Official Artwork Shiny. Shiny versions of pokémon are pokémon with different colors in the pokémon games. They are very difficult to find, and they are often seen as a 'cooler' version. 

Classic

## About

This project was made using the PokeApi: https://pokeapi.co/

- Angular
- TypeScript
- Scss

## Problems

I still have a lot of problems with responsiveness. I would say that, for me, responsiveness at the momment my biggest obstacle. Unfortunately, this project is not responsive at the moment. However, it won't be like this forever because as I learn more about responsiveness, my difficulties with this part of coding will go away, giving me the ability to provide a better experience to mobile users.

It takes a little bit of time until the pages with the generations load at the moment. It will be fixed to make sure the user has a more enjoyable time browsing the site 

## Future Changes 

- Add responsivity
- More info about pokemon games
- Correct the time that it takes to load content in the pages related to the generation 
- Try to ask the creators of the api to see if they can add pokemon voice lines

- Show all Pokemons of a specific type
