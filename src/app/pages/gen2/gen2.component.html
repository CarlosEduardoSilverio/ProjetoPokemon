            <p class="Texto1">The Johto region is a region of the Pokémon world. Johto is located west of Kanto, which together form a joint landmass that is south of Sinnoh and Sinjoh Ruins.<br><br>It was the second core series region to be introduced. First explored in Pokémon Gold and Silver, it is home to an additional 100 Pokémon that were not present in the previous games. It is also the setting of Pokémon Crystal, Pokémon HeartGold, and Pokémon SoulSilver.<br><br> Players begin their journey in New Bark Town, where Professor Elm offers either Chikorita, Cyndaquil, or Totodile to beginning Pokémon Trainers.<br><br>The English-version names of most of the cities in Johto are names of plants or things related to plants.</p>
            <p class="GeoDemo">Geography</p>
            <p class="Texto2">The Johto region, like its neighboring region, Kanto, has a temperate climate. However, Johto's climate is a bit wetter than that of Kanto's.<br><br>Johto is notably more rural than the Kanto region, which leans more towards to the urban side. The region has an abundance of water to the west and south, with Cianwood City most likely being on a separate landmass. However, Johto is still dominated by land. The western parts of the region are mainly low-lying and forested and contain most of the region's population. Johto's ultra-modern Goldenrod City is found in the heart of the region, on the coast. It is the technological, industrial, and economic area of the Johto region. Due to its centralized position in the region, many smaller but important cities and towns connect to the city. There is one large mountain range encompassing almost the entire eastern half of the region, which separates Kanto and Johto and contains Mt. Silver. Blackthorn City is nestled deep between the mountains and is very unique because it is a city for Dragon Tamers.</p>
            <p class="GeoDemo">Demographics</p>
            <p class="Texto2">In the Johto region, including all the towns, cities, and other areas, the total population in HeartGold and SoulSilver is 452. As of Generation VIII, it is the seventh largest region by population.</p>
