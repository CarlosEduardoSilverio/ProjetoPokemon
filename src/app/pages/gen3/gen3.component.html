            <p class="Texto1">The Hoenn region is a region of the Pokémon world. It is located south of Sinnoh, and southwest of both Kanto and Johto. It is the setting of Pokémon Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, Omega Ruby, and Alpha Sapphire. It was the third core series region to be introduced.<br><br>Hoenn is inspired by the real-world Japanese main island of Kyushu. The names of most of the cities in Hoenn are made of two words put together ("Little Root", "Fort Tree", "Slate Port", "Ever Grande", etc.) rather than colors or plants as Kanto and Johto had done. Professor Birch of Littleroot Town offers the starter Pokémon known as Treecko, Torchic, or Mudkip to Trainers beginning their journey of this vast land.</p>
            <p class="GeoDemo">Geography</p>
            <p class="Texto2">The Hoenn region boasts many dramatic environments from rainforests to deserts, but its most striking feature is its abundance of water, a strong contrast to other core series regions, especially Sinnoh. Much of the region is covered in water, almost equal in size to the mainland, exemplifying the theme of the games. There are several large and populated islands off the mainland only accessible via water routes, many of which are deep enough for diving.<br><br>Much of the interior area is forested or mountainous, so most notable cities are found on the coastline. People who live in towns and villages in the mountain areas must adapt to the harsh environment. An extreme example of this is the inhabitants of Fortree City, who live in tree houses. This is in stark contrast to other regions in the Pokémon world, as noted by Ruby in Pokémon Adventures, who preferred Johto's many modernized cities to the wilderness and countryside in Hoenn. Hoenn has one active volcano, Mt. Chimney, in the northwest of the region. The ash from Mt. Chimney regularly falls on the nearby towns and routes. On the opposite side of the Hoenn region lies the volcanicRSE/impactORAS crater which Sootopolis City was built in.<br><br>Some of Hoenn's newly discovered Pokémon strongly reflect the influence of the primarily tropical environment.</p>
            <p class="GeoDemo">Demographics</p>
            <p class="Texto2">The towns, cities, and areas of the Hoenn region's total population in Ruby and Sapphire is 598. In Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, the total population of Hoenn's towns, cities, and areas is 694. Upon its introduction in Generation III, it was the largest region by population. As of Generation VIII, it is the sixth largest region by population.</p>
