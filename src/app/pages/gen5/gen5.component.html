                <p class="Texto1">The Unova region is a region of the Pokémon world. It is the setting of Pokémon Black and White and Pokémon Black 2 and White 2. It was the fifth core series region to be introduced.<br><br>Unova is far away from the four other large regions, and the Pokémon which inhabit Unova are diverse and different from those of Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, and Sinnoh. According to Junichi Masuda, the geographical and social background for Unova draws inspiration from the New York City metropolitan area.[1][2] Although it is geographically based on New York City, it draws inspiration for its landmarks from the entire state of New York, which features a mixture of rural locations and urban areas as well as factory towns and industrial complexes.</p>
                <p class="GeoDemo">Geography</p>
                <p class="Texto2">Unova is divided by two rivers that lead into an ocean to the south of it. These rivers cannot be surfed on, with the exception of the river directly below Village Bridge. It divides Unova into central and eastern peninsulas and a western landmass. These three landmasses are connected by five bridges: the Skyarrow Bridge, the Driftveil Drawbridge, the Tubeline Bridge, Marvelous Bridge, and the Village Bridge. The eastern part of Unova is further divided by mountains that makes a southeast part and northeast part. The southeastern part is important to Trainers who want to compete in the Pokémon league since two Gyms are located there, but the northeastern part is not since there are no Gyms there and it mostly has tourism, as evidenced by the amount of people speaking foreign languages. Further away from this bundle of towns is where the Pokémon League is located. Interestingly, the northeastern part is the only place in the region to find Pokémon species foreign to Unova outside of Swarms. The central peninsula of Unova consists of two of the largest cities in the Pokémon world, Castelia City and Nimbasa City, as well as Opelucid City further north, all of which contain Gyms. Every bridge in Unova connects to the central part of the region from either the east or west. The western side contains medium-sized towns and more varied landscapes but it also has three Gyms there, making it another destination to visit for any Pokémon Trainer.</p>
                <p class="GeoDemo">Demographics</p>
                <p class="Texto2">The Unova region has a total population of 949, including all the towns, cities and areas. Upon its introduction in Generation V, it was the largest region by population and is currently the third largest region by population.</p>
